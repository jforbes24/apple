# Partner Data Analysis Project
This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the Partner Data Analysis project, designed to process, analyze, and share insights from partner-specific data while maintaining confidentiality.

## Project Architecture (TASK 1)
### 1. Create GitHub Repository

- A dedicated GitHub repository is created for each partner to ensure data isolation and secure collaboration.

### 2. Save Data Export/s

- Raw data exports provided by the partner are securely stored for processing.

### 3. Generate Python Script (ETL)

- A Python script is developed to perform Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations:
  - Extract: Retrieve raw data from the provided export(s).
  - Transform: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and usability.
  - Load: Prepare the cleaned dataset for analysis.

### 4. Upload Cleaned Dataset to GitHub

- The cleaned and processed dataset is uploaded to this repository, adhering to data privacy and confidentiality standards.

### 5. Dashboard New Dataset

- A dashboard is created to visualize the cleaned dataset, highlighting key metrics and trends for easy interpretation.

### 6. Share Insights

- Insights are derived from the dataset and shared with the partner, focusing on:
  - Brand per Reseller: Building trust by tailoring insights to specific reseller brands.
  - Trends and Percentages: Emphasizing data-driven trends and percentage-based metrics for clarity.
  - Confidentiality: Reinforcing strict adherence to confidentiality in all shared outputs.



### 7. Share Repository with Partner

- The repository, including scripts, cleaned data, and dashboards, is shared with the partner for transparency and collaboration.

## Notes

- All data handling complies with confidentiality agreements.
- The ETL process and dashboard are designed to be partner-specific and scalable.
- For further details or collaboration, contact the repository administrator.
